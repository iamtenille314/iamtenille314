- 👋 Hi, I’m @iamtenille314!
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full stack engineer/deveoper. I also make candles @bkessencestl and laser and engrave wood and acrylic @bkdesignsstl.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Web Development - Java, HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate, but I'm not sure exactly what on yet as I am just really getting a good grasp on my journey.
